I plan on a versioning system that allows users to match updates in Botania's official releases to those in my own fork.  To do this:

Botania uses a #.#-### sytem.  The #.# denotes a major version, and the second set of numbers (###) denotes the current released build.  For example, as of this edit, Botania is on r1.8-249, meaning (unless I'm mistaken) version is release 1.8, build 249.

I plan to add a number to the build section, denoting the build of this fork, so the convention will change to #.#-###.#.  The first build of this fork will then be 1.8-249.1, the second, 1.8-249.2, etc.  If Botania releases build 250, I will change to 1.8.250.1 for the first build of this fork which reflect the updates in build 250 of Botania's official code.

That being said, I do not expect Vazkii to be releasing any more builds for Botania for Minecraft 1.7.10, but I wanted to have a system in place in case she does.
