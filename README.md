Welcome to the Botania (Unofficial SkyFactory Edition) repository.  

[Botania](http://botaniamod.net/) is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod based on adding natural magic to the game. It's inspired by other magic mods, such as [Thaumcraft](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2011841-) or [Blood Magic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1899223-).

__THIS IS NOT A STANDARD FEATURE OF BOTANIA BY DEFAULT!__ 
This edition adds a "Grass Block Challenge" variation to the Garden of Glass world-type.  Server owners can set this world type by using "level-type=botania-sb-one" in their server.properties file.  Singleplayer users must select the "GoG-One Block" world type from the options.  With this new world type, you start on a single grass block with a sign, and must survive from there, and is intended for play with other mods (like in the Sky Factory modpack).  IF YOU FIND A BUG, check if it exists in Botania's official version, and be sure to report it in the correct issue tracker depending on what you find.  Don't annoy Vazkii with my bugs, or you're going to piss both of us off.
